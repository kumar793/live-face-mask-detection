# Automatic Face MASK Recognition System using OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements an automatic face recognition system using OpenCV. The system can detect and recognize faces in real-time from a webcam feed or from static images. It leverages the power of OpenCV for image processing and face detection, and uses machine learning techniques for face recognition.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Support for multiple faces
- Easy to add new faces to the recognition database
- High accuracy and performance
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-face-recognition.git
   cd automatic-face-recognition
